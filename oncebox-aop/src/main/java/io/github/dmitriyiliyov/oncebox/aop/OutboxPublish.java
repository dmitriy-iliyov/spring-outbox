/**
 * Annotation to mark a method for automatic outbox event publishing.
 * <p>
 * When a method annotated with this is executed, the return value (or a derived value using SpEL)
 * is published as an outbox event.
 * <p>
 * When combined with {@code @Transactional} on the same method, event persistence relies on
 * {@link OutboxPublishAspect} running before the transaction commits, which in turn relies on the
 * transactional advisor keeping Spring's default (unconfigured) {@code LOWEST_PRECEDENCE} order.
 * If the application customizes {@code @EnableTransactionManagement(order = ...)} to a value with
 * higher precedence than the default, the aspect may end up running after commit and publishing
 * will fail with {@code IllegalTransactionStateException}. In that case, call
 * {@link io.github.dmitriyiliyov.oncebox.core.publisher.OutboxPublisher#publish} manually from
 * within the transactional method instead of relying on this annotation.
